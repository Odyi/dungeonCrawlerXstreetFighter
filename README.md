# dungeonCrawlerXstreetFighter
Dungeon Crawler but instead of a normal dungeon ur walking around the streets of a random city learning martial arts from masters and fighting crooks, and maybe tournmanets???


Game works like u run around diffrent rooms or streets fighting gangs or crooks and by that way u earn coins then in different rooms u find senseis for different martial arts and tecniques for example judo, boxing, muay thai, kick boxing, bjj, wrestling, and in each martial arts u have progressions lets say in judo if i use coins and train i get my first belt which is white as i promote by earning xp doing judo moves and going to the sensei to train i go up belts and then i unlock new moves and do more damage with all judo moves thats the main system i want to pursue.

fighting enemies like bosses common enemies multiple enemies gangs or whatever i think is fun idk xd


IN PROGRESS
